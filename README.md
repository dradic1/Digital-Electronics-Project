# Digital Electronics Project – VHDL Implementation on Nexys3  

This repository contains a project developed as part of the **Digital Electronics** course.  
The project is implemented in **VHDL** and deployed on the **Nexys3 development board**.  

---

## Project Description  
The main goal of the project is to design and implement a **digital circuit** that displays a decimal digit (0–9) on **7-segment displays**.  

Key features include:  
- The decimal digit **rotates** across the 7-segment displays from **left to right** every 0.5 seconds.  
- The rotation **direction can be changed** dynamically.  
- The **decimal digit to be displayed** can be selected using switches on the Nexys3 board.  

This project demonstrates practical skills in:  
- Designing synchronous digital circuits in **VHDL**  
- Interfacing with **7-segment displays**  
- Using switches for input control and direction selection  
- Implementing timing and sequential logic

## Technologies Used  
- **VHDL** for hardware description  
- **Nexys3 FPGA development board** for implementation  
- Vivado or ISE toolchain (depending on the setup) for synthesis and deployment

## Purpose  
The project was developed as a **faculty assignment** to demonstrate knowledge in digital circuit design, hardware description languages, and FPGA implementation.  
It combines theoretical knowledge from the course with practical hands-on experience in digital electronics.
